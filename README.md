# NYC-Bayesian-Regression

The following code and examples are for a paper written by William Duquette and Soham Changani called "Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression." There are two important files worth noting. First, there is an R Markdown file that is used for a dice roll example in the paper. This code creates a prior, likelihood, and posterior distribution for each of our two dice roll examples using a Bernoulli likelihood function. Next, you will see a ipynb file where we preform Bayesian Linear Regression. We first conduct Ordinary Least Squares regression and proceed to compare that to our results from our Bayesian Linear Regression. The data we use for our example is a collection of the ratings of various attributes like ambience and food of 168 Italian restaurants in New York City in 2001.
